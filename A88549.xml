            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Meteor or Blazing Star.</head>
            <p>TO write of a Meteor Comet, or Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star is no easie subject, wherefore tis worth thy time, Reader, to understand the nature of a Comet according to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datus.</q>
            <p>A Comet is either as it wore hairie as a Periwig, or else it seems barbated, bearing the similitude of a <hi>Beare,</hi> or else it appeares with a long tail, and such a one was that which appeared in <hi>Irelands</hi> North part, which doth cause there both hope and fear, the Protestants hope it will prove ominous to the Rebels: the Rebels conceited that it will prove to the destruction of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156364:3"/>who truly the first might had ill successe, insomuch that that very night there died in sheep and oxen as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sold would have yeelded five thousand pound. But mistake me not, for the losse of sheep and oxen did not onely happen upon the Protestants, but the Rebels also in losse shared with them, their number being ten for one.</p>
            <p>Also there happened another strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which was this: The vermine were all killed with Frogs; a thing which never before was heard of, no vermine never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting that place, unlesse lice, which they enjoy in such plentie, as if the whole race of them had sprung from the loyns of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> the Egyptian King.</p>
            <p>But now again to the Rebels supposition, who thought the rather that the Blazing Starre would prove prodigious to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, because in <hi>Germany</hi> a Blazing Star did appear a little before the death of that magnanimous Monarch the King of the <hi>Sweedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if upon such grounds they build
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156364:4"/>their cogitations, I shall easily make them recant their opinion, in so much as put them in remembrance, that although he died he died a Conquerour, and in <hi>Lutzan</hi> field with his thirtie-thousand vanquished threescore thousand, so he lost his bloud and saved his honour.</p>
            <p>A King that hath more honoured the Chronicles, then the twelve <hi>Caesars,</hi> or that great <hi>Alexander,</hi> who wished for another world for to overcome. Therefore to his perpetuall memory, he lies entombed in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where he was borne, in a silver Coffin, which is ingraven thus;</p>
            <q>Hic Jacet, Qui in Praelio Lutzune Victor: Omubuit.</q>
            <p>Let this Story be dedicated to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and by it let them learne and assure themselves, that although some great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Protestants may die, which significano Axiome, that he must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die. Wherefore take courage you which belong to <hi>David,</hi> and doe not prophecie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156364:4"/>too late your owne overthowes. For he that was able to make the Sunne stand still in <hi>Gideon,</hi> and the Moone in the valley <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosapha;</hi> and to take away the force of fire, in so much, as it was not able to consume a Bush, is also able to deliver you, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that apparance of what aspect soever.</p>
